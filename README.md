# Discord Code Image
Turns code into images so its easier to debug.

To use this bot first go to the code and read all the comments to edit the stuff that needs to be edited. Then
start the python file then use this command to get code images.

```
.codeprivate void test() //Make sure there is no space between .code and your code so there is not a space at the start of the image.
{
  console.log("Hello World!");
}
```
